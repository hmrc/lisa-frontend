    <p>This could be for a number of reasons.</p>

    <h2>Business name is not an exact match</h2>

    <p>
        Your business name should match the name written on any letters you have from HMRC.
        Check capital letters and spaces in your business name. You need to check that your
        business name uses either 'limited' or <span role="text" aria-label="L.T.D.">'LTD'</span>.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR) does not match</h2>

    <p>
        Your UTR should match the UTR on any letters you have from HMRC. If your UTR number
        is made up of 13 digits, only enter the last 10.
